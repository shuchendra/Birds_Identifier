All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color images in jpg format. Data set includes 525 bird species, 84635 training images, 2625 test images(5 images per species) and 2625 validation images(5 images per species).
This is a very high-quality dataset where there is only one bird in each image and the bird typically takes up at least 50% of the pixels in the image. As a result, even a moderately complex model will 
achieve training and test accuracies in the mid-90 % range
