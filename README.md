# Birds_Identifier

Train a deep learning model for classifying bird species based on images. This could be a valuable tool for birdwatchers or researchers who want to identify birds in the wild.

## About Dataset
Data set of 525 bird species. 84635 training images, 2625 test images(5 images per species) and 2625 validation images(5 images per species. This is a very high quality dataset where there is only one bird in each image and the bird typically takes up at least 50% of the pixels in the image. As a result even a moderately complex model will achieve training and test accuracies in the mid 90% range. Note: all images are original and not created by augmentation.

# DOMAIN 

General image classification using Image data.

# APPLICATIONS 

## Bird Species Classification:
Train a deep learning model for classifying bird species based on images. This could be a valuable tool for birdwatchers or researchers who want to identify birds in the wild.

## Biodiversity Monitoring:
Use the dataset to develop a system for monitoring bird biodiversity in specific regions. By analyzing images captured by cameras in natural habitats, researchers can gain insights into the distribution and abundance of different bird species.

## Wildlife Conservation:
Assist in wildlife conservation efforts by using the dataset to identify and track endangered bird species. Automated monitoring systems can help conservationists assess the impact of environmental changes on bird populations. 

## Ecological Research:
Use the dataset for ecological research to understand the interactions between different bird species and their environments. Automated bird species recognition can contribute to studies on biodiversity, migration patterns, and ecological relationships.

## Citizen Science Projects:
Engage the public in citizen science projects where individuals contribute bird images for classification. This can help researchers collect large amounts of data from diverse locations, supporting broader ecological studies.

## Automated Bird Photography Systems:
Implement automated camera systems in natural environments to capture images of birds. The dataset can be used to train models that automatically identify and catalog bird species, facilitating long-term monitoring projects.

## Augmented Reality (AR) Apps:
Develop AR applications that can recognize and provide information about bird species in real time when users point their smartphones or devices at birds.
